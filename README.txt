Getting and Cleaning Data : Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1- Download and unzip the dataset
2- Load and merge the datasets
3- Add label
4- Extract only the data on mean and standard deviation (keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation)
5- creating a second data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

=> The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
